This app can help you to use decision theory in some practical cases. 

If you want to make rational choice from multiple options you need some formalization.

First you should identify main criteria. For example the criteria of CPUs can be rating, performance, price etc. Then you should set weights for each criterion according to it's importance for you. For example for you performance is twice more important than rating and price. So you can set performance weight as 1 and rating with price as 0.5. Weights' ratios are importnat, not absloute values. One more remark - you should mark price as "Inverted" because bigger price is worse than the lower one when we make a purchase.

Second you should fill table with variants and their criteria values. And this is it. After calculating all weights and values you'll have a result table with normalized values and total column with sums of variants' values.

###########################

There are 4 buttons on the left: "Description", "Weights", "Variants", "Result".
1) "Description" button opens this tab. Here you can set name and description for your task.
2) Click "Weights" button to set criteria and their weights. You can use any numerical values, the program will normalize them automatically. Clicking on "Inverted" checkbox makes this criterion inverted.
3) "Variants" button opens tab with variants' table. Fill it with their criteria values.
4) "Result" opens tab with result table. By the way you can click on table header to sort it according to selected column.

You can look at example at menu "Help" - "Example".

That's all.
